# Breast Cancer Subtype Prediction Using DNA Methylation

This project explores both unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods to identify and classify breast cancer subtypes based on DNA methylation data from TCGA.

The pipeline includes clustering (K-means, Hierirchal, PCA) and classification (Random Forest, XGBoost), applied to high-dimensional genomic features.

Different feature sizes were used depending on the model

The dataset is public and sourced from TCGA. Results include subtype clustering visuals and supervised learning performance metrics.
